# DeepLearning
> ðŸ“• This is a repo for my notes and code snippet from my Deep Learning Journey. Notebooks cover the foundation concepts of DeepLearning, Neural networks and AI project.

- [Neural Networks From Scratch](https://nnfs.io/) How to build a Neural Networks from scatch with Python and Numpy
  - Chapter one : [Introducing to Neuron Network](https://github.com/theaveas/DeepLearning/blob/main/NNFS/01_nnfs_introducing_neural_networks.ipynb) 
  - Chapter two : [Coding your first Neuron Network](https://github.com/theaveas/DeepLearning/blob/main/NNFS/02_nnfs_coding_our_first_neurons.ipynb)
  - Chapter three : [Adding layer](https://github.com/theaveas/DeepLearning/blob/main/NNFS/03_nnfs_adding_layers.ipynb)
  - Chapter Four : Activation Function
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/program/deep-learning-specialization/)
